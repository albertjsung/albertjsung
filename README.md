### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**albertjsung/albertjsung** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I'm Albert, a freshman at Brown studying Applied Math and CS
- Iâ€™m currently working on a project that looks at changes in NBA player efficiency ratings over the years, with a working hypothesis that modern NBA offences (driven by data analytics) have drastically improved player (and team) efficiency; more so than changes in the league's defensive tendencies/capabilities.
- Shoot me an email at albert_sung@brown.edu if you need to reach me. Thanks!
