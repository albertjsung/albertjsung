### Hi there 👋
I'm Albert, a freshman at Brown studying Applied Math and CS

I’m currently working on a project that looks at changes in NBA player efficiency ratings over the years, with a working hypothesis that modern NBA offences (driven by data analytics) have drastically improved player and team efficiency; more so than changes in the league's defensive tendencies/capabilities.

-> Shoot me an email at albert_sung@brown.edu if you need to reach me. Thanks!
